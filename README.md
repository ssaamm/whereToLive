# whereToLive

This is a mashup of a few API's that gets data on cities.

It's not good code (yet).

Also I'm just learning git.

## Setup

You're going to need to make a file called "keys.py" which contains API keys.

## Usage

    python live.py < cityList.txt > out.html

cityList.txt should be a list of cities, one per line, with the city and state separated by a comma

Kinda like this:

    new york, ny
    los angeles, ca
    denver, co
